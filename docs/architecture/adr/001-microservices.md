# ADR-001: Microservices Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to build a scalable e-commerce system that can handle complex business logic, high traffic, and enable independent team development.

## Decision
We will use a microservices architecture with the following services:
- Order Service (Go)
- Payment Service (Go) 
- Inventory Service (Go)
- Notification Service (Python)
- API Gateway (Go)

## Consequences
### Positive
- Independent deployment and scaling
- Technology diversity where appropriate
- Fault isolation
- Team autonomy

### Negative
- Increased operational complexity
- Network latency between services
- Distributed transaction challenges
- Need for sophisticated monitoring
