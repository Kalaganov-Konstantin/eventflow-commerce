## ‚ú® Project Overview

**EventFlow Commerce** is a fully-featured, distributed e-commerce platform built to showcase a modern, cloud-native
architecture. It serves as a practical, hands-on demonstration of how to design, build, and operate a complex,
resilient, and scalable system using cutting-edge, production-ready technologies.

This project is not just about code; it's a comprehensive portfolio piece that illustrates advanced concepts in
microservices, event-driven design, and DevOps. It's designed to be a reference for engineers and a testament to the
skills required to build robust, enterprise-grade applications.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Event-Driven Architecture** with Apache Kafka for maximum decoupling and scalability.
- **Saga Pattern** for maintaining data consistency across distributed transactions.
- **Event Sourcing & CQRS** for a fully auditable and high-performance payment service.
- **Advanced CI/CD** with automated **Canary Releases** using Istio for zero-downtime deployments.
- **Comprehensive Observability** with the "three pillars": metrics (Prometheus), logs (ELK), and traces (Jaeger).
- **Resilient by Design** with built-in Circuit Breakers and Fallback mechanisms.
- **Polyglot Persistence** using the best database for the job (PostgreSQL, Redis).
- **Secure by Default** with automatic mTLS encryption for all internal traffic provided by Istio.
